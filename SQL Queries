# First, we're going to start by looking at the games in each genre, total earnings in each genre, the number of players, and the number of tournaments
# However, a game with less than 15 or so tournaments probably does not have enough base to meaningfully add to player earnings, though they would still
# contribute a significant amount to the player count. As such, games with less than 15 tournaments are removed from the genre count.

# As we can see here, Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas, First Person Shooters, and Battle Royales make up a significantly larger portion of total prize pools
# than other genres. Let's continue by taking a closer look at MOBAs.
