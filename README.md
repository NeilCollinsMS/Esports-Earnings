An analysis of what factors most heavily impact professional esports earnings

This analysis will be derivative of my Senior Economics Thesis (An Analysis of Esports Economics with Supplemental Analysis of Streaming Economies), though my thesis functioned mostly as an in depth case study with minor elements of data analysis incorporated. 

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/esports-earnings 

Note: This data source is pulled from the same site that I used for reference in my thesis (esportsearnings.com), and in my thesis I concluded that events with partial crowdfunding tend to top the charts as far as gross winnings are concerned. Though that data is not openly attached to the data set, I will attempt to explore that correlation in this analysis. 

Unlike some of my earlier SQL projects where I was simply providing demonstrations of queries, I will attempt to provide more analysis and thoughts on each of the queries I write. I may also import this data into R for more statistical analysis.
